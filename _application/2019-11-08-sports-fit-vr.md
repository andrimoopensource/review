<br>
<br>

Play by doing real physical activities! Featuring a total of 275 events to complete. Running races, races with hurdles, sprints, jumps, squats, push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups and a flying mode. These will be enough to get your body in shape.

<br>
<br>

Each level is harder and longer than previous. There are opponents that you must compete against. All of these have 3 difficulty modes, so if you feel the game is easy, you can always try a harder mode.

<br>
<br>

Two Free roam modes. Fly as a bird or run around as a human. One huge island to explore, once you completed your exercises. Crossing the whole map will take you more than 20 min of non-stop running. Unique areas of map with their own features.

<br>
<br>

There are also hundereds of coins to collect scattered everywhere on the island. Waiting to be collected. Many butterflies to chase and catch.
